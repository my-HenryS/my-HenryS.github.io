It significantly reduces the memory footprint by 2.9x to save the DRAM cost on the SSD and it could further benefit SSD performance with a larger data cache. We also presented our work at the WDC 2030 AI Focus seminar.</td><th style='width:35%;'><img src='img/leaftl.png' alt='leaftl' style='width:100%;' /></th> </tr></table> <table><tr><th style='width:35%;'><img src='img/blockflex.png' alt='blockflex' style='width:100%;' /></th><td><b>BlockFlex: A Learning-Based Storage Harvesting Framework [OSDI '22]</b><br> Our study of cloud storage traces shows that cloud storage is significantly underutilized. We developed BlockFlex, which can predict the storage requirements of VMs with high accuracy and harvest idle flash-based storage resources to improve cloud storage utilization. We showed that BlockFlex could improve the storage utilization in data centers by 1.25x and the storage performance of harvest VMs by 22-60%.</td> </tr> </table>"
