We built a lightweight performance variability analysis tool with high detection coverage. We evaluated it on the Tianhe-2 Supercomputer with more than 16,000 parallel processes. We showed that our tool could detect real-world performance variability issues in the supercomputer with minimal performance interference to existing programs.",
