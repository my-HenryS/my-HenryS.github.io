I am a CS Ph.D. candidate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Marc Snir](http://snir.cs.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu). My main research interests include storage systems and ML for systems. More specifically, I am working towards building **learning-based storage systems**, from application-level indexes to storage devices like SSDs. 
Prior to my Ph.D. studies, I obtained my master's degree from UIUC in 2020 and bachelor's degree from Beihang University in 2018.
