<span style="color:#B83C08; font-weight:bold"> I will join Purdue ECE as an Assistant Professor starting Fall 2026! I am looking for prospective PhD and Master's students to work with me. </span>

I am currently visiting the FAIR SysML Group at Meta. 
I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Marc Snir](https://snir.cs.illinois.edu). My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and systems, with a particular focus on the design and implementation of learning-based storage systems. I work across the entire storage stack, from storage hardware development (e.g., solid-state drives) to system software and cloud storage platforms.
