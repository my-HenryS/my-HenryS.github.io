I am a final-year CS Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Marc Snir](https://snir.cs.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu). My research interests are at the intersection of machine learning (ML) and systems, with a particular focus on **building efficient and reliable storage systems using machine learning**. I work across the entire storage stack, from storage hardware development (e.g., solid-state drives) to system software and cloud storage platforms.
