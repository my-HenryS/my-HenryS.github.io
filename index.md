I am a **final-year** CS Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, advised by [Prof. Marc Snir](https://snir.cs.illinois.edu) and [Prof. Jian Huang](http://jianh.web.engr.illinois.edu).  My research focuses on computer systems, specifically **building efficient and reliable storage systems using machine learning**. I work across the entire storage systems stack, from storage devices like SSDs to file systems and cloud storage infrastructure.
